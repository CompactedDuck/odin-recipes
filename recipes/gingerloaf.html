    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This spiced loaf is a winter treat that is perfect for the holiday season. 
        Serve warm with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream
    </p>

    <p>
        As with any homemade cake, cooking times will vary slightly as domestic ovens are not always the most temperature accurate.
        Cooking times will also vary depending on the thickness and dimensions of your loaf tin.
        Cook until a cake tester or wooden skewer can be inserted into the centre of the loaf and come out clean.
