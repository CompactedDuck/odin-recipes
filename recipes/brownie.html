    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        These chocolate brownies are a sure crowd pleaser and come together with almost no effort. 
        The baking time given is approximate; baking for slightly less time yields a gooey brownie, 
        while baking for slightly longer gives a more cake-like texture. 
        <strong>NB. If you plan to make the brownies in advance, cakey brownies are better the next day</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        Beth typically uses Whittakers' Creamy Milk Chocolate for this recipe, but feel free to use your own favourite chocolate. 
        These are your brownies after all! 
        Try expirementing with dark chocolate or use white chocolate for a nice colour contrast with the brownie mix.
